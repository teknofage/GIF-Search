# How to Use This Starter Code

To create your own repository using this code:

1. Clone the repository onto your computer using the `git clone` command
1. Run `git remote remove origin` to disconnect the code from Make-School-Labs
1. In GitHub.com, create your own repository. **IMPORTANT**: Do not add a README
1. Run `git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git`, replacing YOUR_USERNAME with your username and YOUR_REPO_NAME with your repository name
1. Now you should be able to add, commit, and push as normal!

# How to Run This Starter Code

You may need to install `flask` and/or `requests`. To do so, run:

```bash
pip3 install flask
pip3 install requests
```

To run, open the folder containing `app.py` in a Terminal instance, and run:

```bash
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
